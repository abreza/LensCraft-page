        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          Digital creators, from indie filmmakers to animation studios, face a
          persistent bottleneck: translating their creative vision into precise
          camera movements. Despite significant progress in computer vision and
          artificial intelligence, current automated filming systems struggle
          with a fundamental trade-off between mechanical execution and creative
          intent. Crucially, almost all previous works simplify the subject to a
          single point, ignoring its orientation and true volume, severely
          limiting spatial awareness during filming. LensCraft solves this
          problem by mimicking the expertise of a professional cinematographer,
          using a data-driven approach that combines cinematographic principles
          with the flexibility to adapt to dynamic scenes in real time. Our
          solution combines a specialized simulation framework for generating
          high-fidelity training data with an advanced neural model that is
          faithful to the script while being aware of the volume and dynamic
          behavior of the subject. Additionally, our approach allows for
          flexible control via various input modalities, including text prompts,
          subject trajectory and volume, key points, or a full camera
          trajectory. It offers creators a versatile tool to guide camera
          movements in line with their vision. Leveraging a lightweight
          real-time architecture, LensCraft achieves markedly lower
          computational complexity and faster inference while maintaining high
          output quality. Extensive evaluation across static and dynamic
          scenarios reveals unprecedented accuracy and coherence, setting a new
          benchmark for intelligent camera systems compared to state-of-the-art
          models.

        <h2>1 Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The language of cinematography extends far beyond simple camera
          operations, encompassing a rich representation of visual storytelling
          elements that can express distinct styles, perceived motions,
          emotional resonances, and visual perceptions. While this sophisticated
          language holds the capacity to translate a director's narrative vision
          into precise camera movements—just as it does in real-world
          filmmaking—it demands exact alignment and precise execution from
          automated systems. Each camera movement must not merely follow rules,
          but rather embody the director's intent with the finesse of an
          experienced professional cinematographer, whether capturing the subtle
          tension in a dramatic scene or the dynamic energy of an action
          sequence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Current automated approaches fall into two limiting categories.
          Traditional methods sacrifice creative potential for predictability,
          reducing the rich language of cinematography to mechanical executions
          of predefined rules, constraints, and objectives. On the other hand,
          more recent learning-based approaches, while capable of generating
          complex camera sequences, often get lost in this complexity due to
          imbalanced training data distributions and insufficient richness in
          their learning examples. As a result, these methods struggle to
          maintain professional quality while staying faithful to user
          instructions, producing sophisticated sequences that drift from the
          intended cinematographic direction. This fundamental disconnect
          becomes particularly apparent when handling diverse filming scenarios,
          where the balance between professional execution and precise alignment
          with user intent becomes crucial.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, one crucial aspect that prior models often overlook is
          the impact of subject volume. In real-world filmmaking, the scale and
          physical presence of the subject—whether filming from an ant's
          perspective or capturing a building—significantly influence the
          camera's behavior and trajectory. However, most prior works simplify
          the subject by representing it as a point or by modeling it in a fixed
          specific form. This oversimplification, due to limitations in dataset
          complexity, fails to capture the true dynamics of subject volume,
          which is essential for generating realistic and context-aware camera
          movements.
        </p>
        <p>
          This fundamental disconnect motivated us to develop LensCraft, a novel
          approach that bridges the gap between professional cinematographic
          execution and precise user control. In addressing this challenge, we
          first identified two key obstacles: the absence of a unified,
          comprehensive standard for a representative cinematographic language,
          and the lack of a balanced, large-scale, volume-aware dataset that
          covers the full spectrum of camera movements. To overcome these
          challenges, we designed a standard cinematography language to provide
          a unified foundation for our approach and developed the first fully
          open-source, carefully designed simulation framework to generate a
          diverse and well-balanced dataset, serving as the foundational pillars
          required for our model.
        </p>
        <p>
          Leveraging this backbone to combine the solidity of traditional
          rule-based methods with the creativity of neural models, we designed a
          lightweight transformer-based architecture that learns and generates
          complex simulated movements, using only a text prompt or optional key
          frames, enabling it to produce robust and creatively aligned outputs.
          To accommodate a wider range of user instructions, we also provide an
          appendix that converts arbitrary user prompts into our standardized
          cinematographic description.
